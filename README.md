  Used two Machine Learning Algorithms namely Naïve Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks, to classify the data in Data Exfiltration subset extracted from BOT-IoT dataset. The Dataset is created by UNSW and it has open access in IEEE Dataport. Used 80-20 train-test split following Pareto Principle. In terms of accuracy and other machine learning metrics, Naïve Bayes performed better compared to ANN except that Log Loss is more in case of Naïve Bayes.

<h2>How to Run:</h2>
<p>
  1. Extract the Dataset Data_exfiltration.csv to the parent folder of Source Code(ipynb) file.</br>
  2. Run the code using Jupyter Notebook.</br>
  3. Different scenarios(Program A, Program B, Both Programs) are coded in different cells.</br>
  4. Used threading for running both the programs concurrently.</br>
  5. Removed the metrics like Accuracy, Precision from the table to avoid overloading it.</br>
